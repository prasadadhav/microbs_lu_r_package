# About

This set of vignettes documents the **microbs.lu** package for processing **qPCR** and **ddPCR** data, generating calculations and dashboard-ready outputs. It is organized for two audiences:

- **Operators** (non-technical): how to install, set up folders, run the weekly pipeline, and verify results.
- **Developers**: how the package is structured, how to edit functions, rebuild, test, and release.

## Vignette list

- **Getting Started & Quick Pipeline** — an end-to-end walkthrough of a typical weekly run.
- **Pipeline Walkthrough by Stage** — each function family, expected inputs/outputs, and file naming.
- **Troubleshooting & FAQs** — common errors and quick fixes.
- **Developer Guide** — develop, document, test, check, build, and version the package.
- **Examples & Recipes** — small example snippets for common tasks.

> These vignettes are written against the repository `prasadadhav/microbs_lu_r_package`. Function names follow the package namespace `microbs.lu`.
