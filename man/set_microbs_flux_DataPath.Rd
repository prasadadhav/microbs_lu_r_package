\usage{
set_microbs_flux_DataPath(path = "00_flux_data", relative = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string representing the path to be set as the working directory.
The default path is "00_flux_data".}

\item{relative}{A Boolean to use relative path or not. Default is False.}
}
\description{
The data for the flux/flow is to be stored in the "00_flux_data" directory.
It is assumed that the global directory is set using the set_microbs_wdirectory function.
Within this directory there is another director called "Data_Treatment", set using the function set_microbs_connector_dir.
This is just because the direectory structure within the team is like this.
It is not necessary to have a connector (in-between) directory.
This function allows you to set the path for the raw ddPCR data.

# Example usage
set_microbs_wdirectory() # to set default working directory
set_microbs_connector_dir() # to set default connector directory
